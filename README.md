## Development Status

AsyncFlow is currently under prototype development.

# AsyncFlow

AsyncFlow, a JS framework that simplifies asynchronous task management by automating workflows on the cloud (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), focusing on scalability and cost optimization.
We provide an SDK to interact with your cloud provider's API.

## Our Goals

- **Decrease Complexity:**
  Reduce the requirements for extensive configurations and simplify troubleshooting on the developer's side. No more worker queues and setting up infrastructure.
- **Improve Deployment Speed:**
  Enable tasks to run on-demand directly from the cloud environment.
- **Maintain Clear Monitoring:**
  Deliver ongoing, real-time tracking of all active workflows.

### How does it work?

AsyncFlow simplifies cloud function execution by providing a lightweight SDK that abstracts away the complexity of the AWS infrastructure.

Instead of directly managing functions, permissions, or deployments, you use our SDK to define and trigger asynchronous tasks through a unified API.

Asyncflow will handle everything, from environment variables to dependencies and role permissions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

AsyncFlow presents itself as a node package.

```bash
npm install asyncflow
```

You might want to use our CLI in order to use Asyncflow using directories.

```bash
npm -g install asyncflow-cli
```

### Quickstart

To use AsyncFlow with AWS, you need to provide your AWS credentials. Create a **.env** file at the root of your project:

```bash
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

Then, provide your AWS credentials, **AWS_ACCESS_KEY** and **AWS_SECRET_KEY**

```bash
//.env

AWS_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXX
AWS_SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
Make sure the user associated with these credentials has the necessary permissions to perform all intended actions. We recommend following the principle of least privilege.


### Usage

You can use AsyncFlow in two different ways, depending on your needs and project structure:

## 1. Using Asyncflow SDK wrapper

Use AsyncFlow.init() to initialize the AsyncFlow client, then use the addJob() method to declare a new job by passing a callback function that contains the code to be executed asynchronously.

```ts

import {Asyncflow} from 'asyncflow/sdk';

try {
    asyncflowClient = await Asyncflow.init()
    await asyncflowClient.addJob(()=>{
            const foobar = require("./foo/bar.js")
             console.log("Hello World!")
             console.log(s)
        })
}
```


## 2. Using Asyncflow CLI

Use the `asyncflow-cli` to create directories with jobs boilerplates

```bash
asyncflow-cli create foobar node
```
```bash
asyncflow/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ foobar/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json

Job name : foobar
```

```ts
// ./asyncflow/foobar/index.js

export const handler = async (event) => {
  // TODO implement
  const response = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),
  };
  return response;
};

```

The command above creates a directory inside `asyncflow/` named `foobar` with a `index.js` and `package.json` file inside. The job will have the same name as the directory name. You can then write code inside this directory.



```ts
import { initializeAsyncflow } from "asyncflow/sdk";

initializeAsyncflow();
```

As simple as that!
